            <p>Andrea Dworkin, American essayist, is a great figure in <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#feminisme_radical">radical feminism</a>. Born in 1946 and died in 2005, she left her mark thanks to 
                her works and her <strong>political</strong> interventions.</p>
            <p> She is a current feminist despite the fact that she passed out : we will find out why.</p>
        </div>



        <div class="article__content">
            <h2>Pornography : why is it Dworkin's main target?
            </h2>
            <p>Very early, Andrea is involved in the <strong>feminist struggle</strong>. Her father, a socialist schoolteacher, transmitted his passion for social justice. 
                Her mother hoped that abortion and birth control would become acceptable to society. Despite conflicts with, Andrea was inspired 
                by her.</p>
            <p> Her life was peaceful during her childhood, but she suffered events that would change her: </p>
            <ul class="andrea_dworkin__list">
                <li>a sexual assault at the age of nine,</li>
                <li>an undeserved punishment in sixth grade for being Jewish,</li>
                <li>a very violent vaginal touching when she was in prison (after a demonstration against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam war</a>),</li>
                <li>a marriage that will bind her to a violent man...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These events will forge her militancy and her adhesion to <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#feminisme_radical">radical feminism</a>.
                For the author :</p>
                
                <div class="article__quote">
                    <q>pornography is the representation of 
                        humiliation and violence against the female sex.</q>
                </div>
            <p>It is necessary to put an end to it, according to her.</p>
            
            <div class="article__figure">
                <figure>
                    <div class="article__image-center">

            </div>

            <p> It is necessary to put an end to it, for the author. She also denounces the use of anti-obscenity laws that would allow, against the desired effect, to publish explicitly violent content against women.</p>
            <p>This is not specific to the essayist, but the anti-pornography activists also think that these contents are sources of divorce and break-ups. The content is also believed to be the cause of the increasing number of <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#seropositif">HIV positive</a> people in the last decades.</p>

            <h2>How did she fight pornography?
            </h2>
           <p>Dworkin denounces the mistreatment of women within the pornographic industry through books, interviews, demonstrations... We 
            will see some examples..
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1979, she published <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Pornography-Possessing-Women-Andrea-Dworkin/dp/0704338769">« Pornography : Men Possessing Women »</a>, one of her best-sellers. This book illustrates the author's 
            thoughts about <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#pornographie">pornography</a> : a dehumanizing industry and a culture of hatred towards women. 
            She explains that the violence of <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#pornographie">pornography</a> is reflected in society, with the eroticization of sexual violence by men. 
            This violence also takes place in pornographic productions : 
            female employees are mistreated and/or abused.
           </p>
           <p>She published other books and texts of theories, promoting respect for women and 
            denoting hatred towards them.
            </p>

                She participated in many demonstrations, including one with 3,000 women through the San Francisco <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#quartier_chaud">red-light district</a>. 
                Dworkin participated in the Meese Commission to remove men's magazines 
                (such as Penthouse or Playboy) from small supermarket chains. 
            </p>
            <p>The writer, along with <strong>Catharine MacKinnon</strong> (a feminist lawyer) , drafted a proposed ordinance that defined <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#pornographie">pornography</a> as a form of sex discrimination. It allows rape victims to sue the pornographic productions responsible of the assault. Several cities in America 
                adopted this text in the 1980s, but it was later declared unconstitutional by various federal courts.
            </p>

            <h2>Andrea Dworkin's other struggles</h2>
            <p>
                The author has faced many other issues. In her second most famous work, <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Intercourse-Andrea-Dworkin/dp/0465017525">« Intercourse »</a>, she opens her analysis of <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#pornographie">pornographie</a> to 
                sexual relations in general.
                She denounces <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#patriarcat">patriarchy</a> and androcentrism, which are accentuated in heterosexual sex.
            </p>
            <p>
                She also fights against the numerous criticisms that affect her. Some question her struggle, finding her too "extreme". According to 
                them, Dworkin argued that sex in any form is rape. 
                Others called her a <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#misandre">misandre</a> person. 
                Some critics say that sex workers need more concrete support than being categorized as victims. 
                

                Finally, <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#pro_sexe">pro-sex feminists</a> opposed her ideas, especially during the <a href="eng_glossaire.html/#sex_wars">Sex Wars</a> of 
                the 1970s and 1980s. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Andrea Dworkin fought her last battle in hospital against complications of diseases affecting her legs and arteries. She died in her 
                sleep in April 2005. Many friends and feminists will commemorate her death. MacKinnon, one of her greatest allies, paid tribute to 
                her at the<br> 
                <strong>« Andrea Dworkin Commemorative Conference »</strong>. 
                After her death, her struggle will be taken up by many other figures, and 
                still relevant today.
